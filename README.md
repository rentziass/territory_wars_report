# Territory Wars Report
Part of SWGOH Tools familiy, you can use this tool to get a comparison in a spreadsheet format of two guilds and better coordinate your guild members for your next Territory War. [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/rentziass/territory_wars_report/releases)

## Getting started
To start using this tool, simply download the [release](https://github.com/rentziass/territory_wars_report/releases) for your OS, launch it and provide the full [swgoh.gg](https://swgoh.gg/) URL of both guilds. This app lacks a user interface, so don't be scared when your OS terminal opens up! Once the data gathering process is over you will find a spreadsheet in the same folder where the executable file is.

> If you're on a Mac you need to allow the execution of apps provided by unknown developers. This tool is completely safe, and you can turn on that setting by following [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpVqkyXFy4)
